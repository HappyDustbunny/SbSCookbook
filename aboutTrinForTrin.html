        <h1>Step-by-step Cookbook</h1>
        <p> This cookbook is made for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-elusive-brain/202004/neurodiversity-the-movement">
            neurodiverse people</a> who struggle with the level of memory and planning normally assumed
            by authors of cookbooks. <br> This also makes the cookbook ideal for children and people new to cooking. </p>
        <p> The recipies is choosen to be both easy and delicious. The complexity is higher for the
          latter recipies in each category.</p>
          <p>The more complex recipies is so good they are worth the trouble ;-)</p>
        <p> As we have to eat less red meat in the future, the focus is on vegetarian/vegan recipies. </p>
        <p> As you work through the recipies you can keep track of your progress by checking the checkboxes. The
          button (End) at the bottom of each recipy empty the checkboxes and reset the accordion.</p>
        <p> The button at the upper right corner unfold the recipies. Unfold all to search for recipies
          or ingredience with your browsers Search-In-This-Page tool (ctrl+f on computers).</p>
        <p> At the bottom is some advice on how to shop and avoid stress in the kitchen. </p>
        <p> When you bake this <a href="https://madshorn.dk/baking/tempmix/index.html">temperturemixer</a> can help
          you get the right temperature without a thermometer.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The cookbook can be printed from the browser. Unfold all recipies with the button in
          the upper right corner and press ctrl+p. Firefox prints each new recipy starting on a new page.
          This is practical for hanging the prints on the refridgerator with magnets. Then use a
          magnet to follow progress.</p>
        <br>
        <p> There is no tracking or cookies as far as I know :-)</p>
        <p> There is an <a href="https://unlicense.org/">&quot;unlicense&quot;</a> on the cookbook, so
          you can share and steal to your hearts content. </p>

          where you can fork it or send pull requests. I will give no guarantee to use suggestions and
          I may be slow to respond :-)</p>

            but hate rigid plans </p>
